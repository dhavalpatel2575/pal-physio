<p>Have you recently been injured in a motor vehicle accident?</p>



<p>Motor vehicle accidents by their nature are stressful, both emotionally and physically. Understandably, you might not know what you should do. Once injuries occur, it is common to experience pain, discomfort, reduced mobility, stiffness, or headaches. Some times these symptoms are delayed and may not immediately appear after your accident. This pain can interfere with your activities of daily living, work, recreational activities, and progress over time, that is why it is important to initiate care as soon as possible.</p>



<ul><li>One of the most common injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents is Whiplash. Whiplash is described as the sudden and violent movement of the neck from forward to backward or side to side. This sudden movement can result in severe and some times sharp pain. Some other conditions we treat for MVA patients are, not limited toâ€¦lower back pain, neck pain, shoulder strain, rotator cuff injury, knee injuries, fibromyalgia, headache.</li></ul>
